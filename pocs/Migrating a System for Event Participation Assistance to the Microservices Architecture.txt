Migrating a System for Event Participation Assistance to the Microservices Architecture
Monolithic architecture systems, which are systems composed of a single logical and 
executable unit, are, in general, hard to scale once any modification made in a small 
part of the system requires it to be rebuilt and redeployed as a whole. One way to ease 
this aspect, which is even more problematic in bigger information systems, is to follow 
modern low cost architecture proposals, as the one that advises the microservices usage. 
However, migrating legacy monolithic systems specifically to the microservice scenario 
is a challenging task, with proposals and background still incipient within the literature. 
This work consists of a migration proposal to the microservice architecture of a monolithic 
system for event participation assistance and the comparison of the software quality between 
the resulting product and the old version. For the migration results study and evaluation it 
was applied the metrics lines of code, comments rate, time of features conclusion and rework 
rate, those points to a maintainability degradation caused by the monolith complexity, which 
doesn't happen so steeply in the microservice architecture. After all, it is concluded that 
the microservice architecture adoption contributed to increased team expectation, development 
efficiency, good practices usage inducement, test development ease and speed of feature release 
to production (Time to market).
