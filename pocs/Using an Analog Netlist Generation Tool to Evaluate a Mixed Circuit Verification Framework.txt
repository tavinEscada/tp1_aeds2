Using an Analog Netlist Generation Tool to Evaluate a Mixed Circuit Verification Framework
The growing demand for powerful integrated circuits in terms of power consumption 
and processing creates a big obstacle for hardware verification engineers to ensure 
Integrated Circuit (IC) quality. Actually, IC verification consumes more than half 
of the development cycle. And with the growing complexity, the verification also 
increases. When we consider analog blocks in mixed-signal ICs, we have an even more 
challenging verification process. Unfortunately, the environments for mixed-signal 
verification are inefficient because it is not possible to generate realistic analog 
outputs to the digital blocks' inputs during simulation. This work evaluates ALIAS, 
a tool that generates digital abstractions of analog circuits for verification. To 
evaluate ALIAS efficiency, we have created an ADC and DAC netlist tool generator to 
perform verification in different mixed-signal scenarios and circuit configurations.
