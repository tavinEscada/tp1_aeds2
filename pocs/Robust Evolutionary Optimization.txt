Robust Evolutionary Optimization Algorithm for
Multi-objective Environmental/Economic Dispatch
Problem with Uncertainties

The economic load dispatch problem has been
formulated as the minimization of total fuel cost needed to
generate electricity in power plants. Due to the environmental
issues that arise from the emissions of polluting gases produced
by fossil-fueled electric power plants, it becomes the environmental/economic dispatch (EED) multi-objective optimization
problem. EED problems have been most commonly solved using
deterministic models (without considering uncertainties). In this
context, a robust model to cope with uncertainties is necessary,
because the deterministic model is not able to reflect some real
condition in practical applications, since fuel cost and emission
coefficients may be subjected to inaccuracies, for instance. In
this paper, both deterministic and robust EED problem models
are first formulated, and the Robust Evolutionary Optimization
Algorithm - REOA is proposed. For the robust model, the
worst case scenario is estimated, to find reliable solutions that
still feasible and have a good performance under the action of
parametric uncertainties. Comparative studies are carried out to
examine the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Simulation
results are presented for the standard IEEE 30-bus system. The
obtained results are satisfactory compared to the best solutions
found in the literature.
