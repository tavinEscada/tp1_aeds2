A Mesh Sensor Network based on Bluetooth Comparing Topologies to Crop Monitoring
The growth of the world population increases the demand for food and other products 
from agriculture. Therefore, it is increasingly needed to enhance and optimize the 
productivity of farms. Through using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and the application 
of the internet of things (IoT) technologies, we can better monitor the condition of farm 
crops. In this work, we designed a Bluetooth Low Energy mesh network joined fluorescence 
sensors for agricultural crop monitoring, and also we evaluated the suitability of this 
solution in a crop field scenario.
