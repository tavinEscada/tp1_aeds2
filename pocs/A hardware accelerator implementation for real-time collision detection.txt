A hardware accelerator implementation for real-time collision detection
Collision detection algorithms are used to detect when virtual objects collide and the results of these collisions. This type of algorithm is used by many research areas such as simulation, automatic path finding, tolerance checking, among others. This type of algorithm is processed in real-time.
Intel created the HARP Platform, which uses a PCI with 8 GB/s bandwidth. This decreased the memory latency, allowing real-time processing of fine-grain applications such as collision detection algorithms.
In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous system in order to use the FPGA on the HARP as an accelerator for collision detection algorithms. Our results show a speedup of 14.5% in execution time.
