The tendency of discussing politics in Online Social Networks (OSNS) has become increasingly growing, especially in election periods. This growth may be justified by the little restrictive format of the information to be published and also by many politicians conducting their respective campaigns on these networks due to the limitation of the free political advertising time. According to this trend and to the large amount of data generated by users of these social networks, the objective of this work is to analyze the impact of bots during the candidacy of Fernando Haddad and Jair Messias Bolsonaro in the Brazilian presidential election of 2018 and, additionally, their possible voters, by using comments collected from YouTube. Our results demonstrate that, considering all the unique users of the collected data set, approximately 71.44% of them were considered undecided, 17.67% as potential Bolsonaro voters and 10.89% as potential Haddad voters, with no evidence of political manipulation by bots.
