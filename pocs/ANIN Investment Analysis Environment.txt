ANIN: Investment Analysis Environment
Abstract— Due to the availability and ease of handling our financial
resources by applications, investments in variable income have
become popular and have become, over the last few years, one of the
first options for people looking for alternatives to monetize their
capital. However, many applications that have tools of interest to
investors are paid or depend on some level of knowledge in
programming languages. In this context, we present the present work
that provides a free interactive dashboard created from the Shiny
package of the R language that applies the Machine Learning
algorithm called XGBoost to predict the closing price of assets. Our
application also provides asset price charts by periods of interest to
the investor, price boxplot, candlestick charts and has a screen that
provides results from the Markowitz Theory. Thus, we believe that the
application created has the potential to help investors, especially
beginners, to make more assertive decisions about investments in
variable income on the São Paulo Stock Exchange. Finally, we
present comparisons of the prediction results observed using the
XGBoost algorithm and an artificial neural network used in the areas
of artificial intelligence and deep learning called Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM). We observed that the results obtained by applying
the XGBoost algorithm present better results in most cases.
