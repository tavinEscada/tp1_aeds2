Novel Three-Input Gates for Silicon Quantum Dot
Atomic Silicon Quantum Dot (SQD) is a prominent
alternative to the current Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) 
transistor due to the low energy consumption
and high integration potential. This emerging technology applies
Silicon Dangling Bonds (DBs) that behave similarly to quantumdots. Moreover, 
it does not require cryogenic temperatures,
unlike other quantum-dot-based approaches. This paper proposes
two novel 3-input gates, and
ANDOR Hence, we compare these 3-input
designs with the equivalent circuits composed of 2-input gates.
We use the state-of-the-art simulator, named SiQAD, to design
and validate our experiments. Our main contribution is the novel
3-input gate designs that provide area and energy reductions. We
achieve an average of 53% energy savings for all 3-input gates
compared to the equivalent circuit built with 2-input gates.
