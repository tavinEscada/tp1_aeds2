CGRA HARP Virtualization of a Reconfigurable Architecture on the Intel HARP Platform
Researches in heterogeneous computing have shown that the usage of more than one computational 
node in the same system increases the performance and decreases the energy consumption. There 
are some types of architectures that have many advantages, both in performance increasing and 
in energy efficiency, such as architectures that possess an FPGA as an accelerating unit. An 
example of this type of architecture is the HARP, recently launched by Intel. Currently, in 
order to use the HARP’s FPGA, the developer must implement an accelerating functional unit 
(AFU) and perform the synthesis of this unit in the FPGA, but this synthesis may demand a 
considerable time, making the architecture unfeasible for a real-time system that requires 
the FPGA reconfiguration. Thus, in this work it is presented an abstract layer for the HARP’s 
FPGA, which allows the FPGA reconfiguration with no need to perform a new synthesis, making 
this architecture feasible for a real-time system.
